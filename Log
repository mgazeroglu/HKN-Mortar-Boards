Colin, Richard
Setup Git repository
Installed CCS and XCTU
Connected to XBee3 via UART

Next time:
Install CCS and XCTU
Setup Git and create branches
Configure radios to communicate


2/18/19
Colin, Max
Max setup Github and is waiting to join
Max installed XCTU
Max talked to COlin about the math behind the mesh network
Were able to get two radios to run a sucessful distance check!!! (see video for settings)

Next Time:
Try to make the radios communicate with each other using UART
Max can bring his XMEGA from uP to test UART on radios (more familiar than MSP430 for now)
Get Juan to setup Github and install XCTU

2/19/19
Max, Juan
Max explained the overview of the project and prior efforts; Juan downloaded XCTU
Max unsuccessfully attempted to have two ZigBees communicate with each other through a microcontroller
Juan investigated the required power consumption of each node and corresponding battery sizes and prices

Next Time:
Further work on microcontroller Zigbee communication
Determining LED quanity and type to minimize price and power and maximize luminosity, and corresponding battery
